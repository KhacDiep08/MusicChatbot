🌟 Features

Answer questions about songs, artists, lyrics, mood, and genres.

Web interface built with Gradio for seamless user interaction.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): combines external song database with LLMs for more accurate answers.

Easily extendable: add new songs or update models without rewriting the code.

Supports multiple NLP backbones like DistilBERT and LLaMA.

🛠️ Technology Stack

Large Language Models (LLMs): DistilBERT, LLaMA.

Transformers (HuggingFace): for model implementation and tokenization.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): to incorporate external knowledge from song datasets.

Gradio: to build an interactive web interface.

Python ecosystem: PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, and other scientific libraries.

🎯 Purpose

Provide instant music-related information in a conversational manner.

Demonstrate practical LLM + RAG integration for real-world applications.

Serve as a foundation for building more advanced chatbots in entertainment or other domains.

🖼️ How it works (Conceptual Flow)

User Input: User asks a question about a song, artist, or lyrics.

Information Retrieval: The RAG component searches the song database for relevant content.

Language Model Response: LLM generates an accurate, context-aware answer using retrieved data.

Web Display: Response is shown on a Gradio web interface.

🚀 Why MusicChatbot?

Lightweight yet powerful: suitable for small datasets and limited hardware.

Modular and flexible: swap models, update databases, or tweak RAG pipeline easily.
