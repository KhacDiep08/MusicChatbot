"Friends told her she was better off at the bottom of a river Than in a bed with him He said ""Until you try both, you won't know what you like better Why don't we go for a swim?"" Well, friends told her this and friends told her that But friends don't choose what echoes in your head When she got bored with all the idle chit-and-chat Kept thinking 'bout what he said  I'll swim even when the water's cold That's the one thing that I know Even when the water's cold  She remembers it fondly, she doesn't remember it all But what she does, she sees clearly She lost his number, and he never called But all she really lost was an earring The other's in a box with others she has lost I wonder if she still hears me  I'll swim even when the water's cold That's the one thing that I know Even when the water's cold If you believe in love You know that sometimes it isn't Do you believe in love? Then save the bullshit questions Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't Sometimes it's just how the light hits their eyes Do you believe in love?",sadness
"Well I heard it, playing soft From a drunken bar's jukebox And for a moment I was lost In remembering, what I never forgot And I never felt guilt about The trouble that we got into I just couldn't let that honey hide inside of you And just because now it's different Doesn't change what it meant  And when I hear that song You know I'm only gonna Think about one girl I think about you When I sing this song You know I'm only gonna Sing it for one girl Ooh ooh ooh  Well I heard it, playing loud I never knew what it was about Till I fell silent in a crowd I just turned around and walked straight out 'Cause I guess I felt guilty About the trouble that I caused you Putting myself first, just like I always do But that doesn't change how I feel 'Cause when I hear it, it feels real And when I hear that song You know I'm only gonna Think about one boy I think about you And when I sing this song You know I'm only gonna Sing it for one boy Ooh ooh ooh  Well, I can't forget Things you said or your kisses And I keep your secrets Where I keep your promises But you need my confessions About as much as you need my lies And I guess it took that song to make me realize  [Instrumental Break]",sadness
"Oh my god, did I just say that out loud? Should've known this was the kind of place That that sort of thing just wasn't allowed Should've known by the color of the drapes (Oh, my bad, venetian blinds) What the hell was I thinking saying exactly what's on my mind? But I won't deny I got a dirty mouth My mother tried, my father tried, my teachers tried But they couldn't wash it out And look at me now up here running my mouth I just open it up and see what comes running out  Like I give a fuck, like I give a shit Like I give a fuck about that shit Like I give a fuck about that motherfucking shit  And you can tell the president to suck my fucking dick Does that sound intelligent? Like I give a fucking frick Tell the FBI put me on the list because Lennon wasn't this dangerous Call the Christians, tell them all that I'm taller than Jesus They tore down the parking lot and put in a parking lot and what do they got? And if you followed the plot then you know I'm not going to give it a second thought Yeah, let those pigs play because they'll all fucking pay Yeah, karma's a fact, that shit'll come back someday And I'll be like Like I give a fuck, like I give a shit like I give a shit about that fuck Like I give a fuck about that motherfucking shit",joy
"[Verse 1] Remember when I called you on the telephone? You were so far away It was raining in New York, did I forget to say?

Should we be? Should we be together for like ever, girl? Shouldn't we? Should we be? Should we be together for like ever, girl?  [Verse 2] We drove across the bridge and I knew that we'd be okay On an early summer's day No clouds up in the sky, did I forget to say? You'd been up all night before I'd barely slept at all It's the kind of thing that's sure to make you feel so small And I asked you ""Do you remember that phone call?"" [Chorus] Shouldn't we?

"One drink, two drinks, three drinks, four She had eyes that I couldn't ignore Chatted her up out on the dance floor She was out of cigarettes so I walked her to the store  Skirt pulled up, pushed up against the wall But she pauses just the take a call Joanne says ""girl, what the fuck are you doing?
