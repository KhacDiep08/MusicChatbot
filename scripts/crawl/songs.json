Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\n\n\nSo, I sneak out to the garden to see you\n\nWe keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\n\nSo, close your eyes\n\nEscape this town for a little while\n\nOh, oh\n\n\n\n'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter\n\nAnd my daddy said, \"Stay away from Juliet.\"\n\nBut you were everything to me\n\nI was begging you, \"Please don't go!\"\n\nAnd I said\n\n\n\n\"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\n\nI'll be waiting.

They're tryna tell me how to feel\n\nThis love is difficult but it's real\n\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\n\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nI got tired of waiting\n\nWondering if you were ever coming around\n\nMy faith in you was fading\n\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\n\nAnd I said\n\n\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\n\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\n\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\n\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\n\nI love you, and that's all I really know\n\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\n\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",

How fucked up is you?\n\nYou got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counseling\n\nTo help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some\n\nAnd what's this shit about us meant to be together?\n\nThat type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other\n\nI really think you and your girlfriend need each other\n\nOr maybe you just need to treat her better\n\nI hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time\n\nBefore you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine\n\nIf you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but, Stan\n\nWhy are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan\n\nI just don't want you to do some crazy shit\n\nI seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick\n\nSome dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge\n\nAnd had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid\n\nAnd in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to\n\nCome to think about it, his name was... it was you\n\nDamn!",

Yeah\n\n\n\n'Cause nothing lasts forever\n\nAnd we both know hearts can change\n\nAnd it's hard to hold a candle\n\nIn the cold November rain\n\n\n\nWe've been through this such a long, long time\n\nJust tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah\n\nBut lovers always come and lovers always go\n\nAnd no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away\n\nIf we could take the time to lay it on the line\n\nI could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine\n\n\n\nSo, if you want to love me\n\nThen, darlin', don't refrain\n\nOr I'll just end up walkin'\n\nIn the cold November rain\n\n\n\nDo you need some time on your own?\n\nDo you need some time all alone?\n\nOoh, everybody needs some time on their own\n\nOoh, don't you know you need some time all alone?\n\n\n\nI know it's hard to keep an open heart\n\nWhen even friends seem out to harm you\n\nBut if you could heal a broken heart\n\nWouldn't time be out to charm you, whoa-whoa\n\n\n\nSometimes, I need some time on my own\n\nSometimes, I need some time all alone\n\nOoh, everybody needs some time on their own\n\nOoh, don't you know you need some time all alone?\n\n\n\nAnd when your fears subside\n\nAnd shadows still remain, ooh yeah\n\nI know that you can love me\n\nWhen there's no one left to blame\n\n\n\nSo, never mind the darkness\n\nWe still can find a way\n\n'Cause nothin' lasts forever\n\nEven cold November rain\n\n\n\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\n\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\n\nEverybody needs somebody\n\nYou're not the only one, you're not the only one\n\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\n\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\n\nEverybody needs somebody\n\nYou're not the only one, you're not the only one\n\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\n\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\n\nEverybody needs somebody\n\nYou're not the only one, you're not the only one\n\nDon't ya think that you need somebody?\n\nDon't ya think that you need someone?\n\nEverybody needs somebody",
