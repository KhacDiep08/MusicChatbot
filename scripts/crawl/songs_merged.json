    "lyrics": "[Intro: Press Release] In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias Makaveli. Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from Hawaiian Sophie fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:  [Spoken: 2Pac] It's not about East or West It's about niggas and bitches Power and money, ridaz and punks Which side are you on? *Heartbeat* *Gunshots* *Encroaching footsteps* These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'? You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don) Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass) (Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!  [Verse 1: 2Pac] Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an Niggas get shook like 5-0 My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty Born on a dope fiend's titty, (huh) in every city You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know I mean? I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall This for my dogs, down to die for y'all Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em My whole team trained to explode, ride or die Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater Two big pits, I call them my bitch-nigga eaters And not a whimper until I'm gone Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay! West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya Should have never fucked with me I want money, hoes, sex and weed I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first [Chorus: 2Pac] We bomb first when we ride Please reconsider 'fore you die We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first We bomb first when we ride Please reconsider 'fore you die We ain't even come to fight tonight But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first  [Verse 2: E.D.I.

Simply smashing in a fashion that's timely Madvillain dashing in a beat-rhyme crime spree We rock the house like rock 'n roll Got more soul than a sock with a hole Set the stage with a goal To have the game locked in a cage getting shocked with a pole Overthrow 'em like throwing Rover a biscuit A lot of bitches think he's overly chauvinistic Let go his dick if that's the case Rats, what a waste, there's more cats to chase— Dogs, he got it like new powers Woke up, wrote and spit the shit in a few hours Sheesh! Been unleashed since the glee club Had your fam saying, Please make me a dub Well, since you ask kindly Where he been behind the mask, who can't find me? You're blind, in the wine zone, leave your mind blown When he shine with the 9, he's a rhinestone... Cowboy [Interlude: MF DOOM] [Applause] No, no, no, no enough  [Verse 2: MF DOOM] Goony goo-goo, loony cuckoo Like Gary Gnu off New Zoo Revue, but who knew The mask had a loose screw? Hell, could hardly tell Had to tighten it up like the Drells and Archie Bell It speaks well of the hyper base Wasn't even tweaked and it leaked into cyberspace Couldn't wait for the snipes to place At least a tracklist in bold print typeface Stopped for a year Come back with thumbtacks, pop full of beer We're hip hop sharecroppers Used to wear flip flops, now rare gear coppers He's in it for the quiche You might as well not ask him for no free shit, capiche? Oh, my aching hands From raking in grands and breaking in mic stands Villain—his smile stuns ya chick While he put himself in your shoes run ya kicks You heard it on the radio, tape it Play it in your stereo, your crew'll go apeshit Raw lyrics—he smells 'em like a hunch The same intuition that tells him spike the punch Curses, he's truly the worsest With enough rhymes to spread throughout the boundless universes Let the beat blast, she told him wear the mask He said you bet your sweet ass It's made of fine chrome alloy Find him on the grind, he's the rhinestone cowboy [Interlude] [Applause]  [Outro] Sometimes they were comedic— or relentlessly horrifying They were the foes of society, whether fighting the local sheriff, or a secret agent Frequently they mirrored our times: the gangster villains which rival real newspaper headlines of the present day Collectively, they are the components which have fueled nightmares for decades to come The villains  [Applause]",

We came to my stop The street light reflects off the piss on the ground Which reflects off the hamburger sign as it turns round Which reflects off the chrome of the BMW Which reflects off the fact that I'm broke Now what the fuck is new? I need loot, I spot the motherfucka in the tweed suit And I'm in his ass quicker than a kick from a greased boot Eased up slow and discreet Could tell he was suspicious by the way he slid his feet Didn't want to fuck up the come-up So I smiled with my eyes said hey, how's it hanging guy? Bumped into his shoulder, but he passed with no reaction Damn this motherfucka had hella Andrew Jacksons! I'm a thief, or pickpocket - give a fuck what you call it Used to call 'em fat cats, I just call them wallets Getting Federal: ain't just a klepto Mastercard or Visa? I gladly accept those Sneaky motherfucka with a scam, know how to pull it Got a mirror in my pocket, but that won't stop no bullets Story just begun, but you already know Ain't no need to get down, shit, I'm already low [Chorus] Get down, get down, get down Get down, get down, get down Get down, get down, get down Get down, get down, get down  [Verse 2] My footsteps echo in the darkness My teeth clenched tight like a fist in the cold sharp mist I look down and I hear my stomach growling Step to Burger King to attack it like a Shaolin I never pay for shit that I can get by doing dirt Linger to the girl cashier and start to flirt All up in her face and her breath was like murder Damn, the shit I do for a free hamburger! Well you got my number, you gon' call me tonight? It depends: is them burgers attached to a price? I'm just kidding, I'ma call, even write you love letters Thanks for the burgers, um, hook me up with a Dr Pepper That's cool, you want some ice? Yeah, and some fries would be hella nice Damn my manager's coming, play it off, okay? 'Have a nice day!' I'm up outta here anyway  I use peoples before they use me Cause you could get got by an Uzi over an OZ That's what an OG told me Gots to find someplace warm and cozy to eat the Victuals that I just got Came to a underground parking lot This place is good as any, fuck it, it's all good Walked in, found a car, hopped and sat up on the hood Ate my burger, threw back my cola Somebody said hey, it was a rent-a-pig, I thought it was a roller Want me to call the cops? I don't want them to see me Looked down and saw that I was sitting on a Lamborghini It was Rollses, Ferraris, and Jags by the dozen A building door opened; damn, it was my cousin Getting off of work, dressed up, no lie Tux, cummerbund, and a black bow tie I was like hey! Who is it? Me Oh, what's up man, I just quit this company They hella racist and the pay was too low I said right, what was up in there though? A party with rich motherfuckas, I don't know the situation I know they got cabbage, owning corporations IBM, Chrysler and shit is what they said Just then a light bulb went off in my head They be thinking all black folks is resembling Give me your tux and I'll do some pocket-swindling Finna change in the bathroom and not freeze off my nuts Lets take a short break while I get into this tux [Pre-Chorus] Alright, I'm ready  [Chorus] Get down, get down, get down Get down, get down, get down Get down, get down, get down Get down, get down, get down  [Verse 3] Fresh, dressed like a million bucks I be the flyest motherfucka in an afro and a tux My arm is at a right angle, up, silver tray in my hand May I interest you in some caviar, ma'am? My eyes shoot around the room there and here Noticing the diamonds in the chandelier Background Barry Manilow, Copacabana And a strong-ass scent of stogies from Havana Wasn't no place where a brother might've been Snobby old ladies drinking champagne with rich white men Alright then: let's begin this Nights like this is good for business Five minutes in the mix, noticed several different cliques Talking, giggling and shit With, one motherfucka in betwixt And everybody else jocking him, throttling Found out later he owns Coca Cola bottling Talking to a black man, who's he? Confused me, looking hella bougie Ass all tight and seditty Recognized him as the mayor of my city Who treats young black men like Frank Nitti Mr Coke said to Mr Mayor: You know, we got a process like Ice Ts hair We put up the funds for your election campaign And, oh, um, waiter can you bring the champagne? Our real estate firm says opportunity's arousing To make some condos out of low-income housing Immediately, we need some media heat To say that gangs run the street and then we bring in the police fleet! Harass and beat everybody till they look inebriated When we buy the land, motherfuckas will appreciate it Don't worry about the Urban League or Jesse Jackson My man that owns Marlboro donated a fat sum That's when I stepped back some to contemplate what few know Sat down, wrestled with my thoughts like a sumo Ain't no one player that could beat this lunacy Ain't no hustler on the street could do a whole community This is how deep shit can get It reads macaroni on my birth certificate Puddin'-Tane is my middle name, but I can't hang I'm getting hustled, only knowing half the game [Outro] Shit, how the fuck I get up out this place?",

[Verse 2] City lights from far away can make you drop your jaw Sparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras There's beauty in the cracks of the cement When I was five, I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent  Whatever it was that could break my momma's back Little did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac And matter of fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract And on the track, she went from beautiful to battle axe  And back at home, she would cry into her pillow Vomit in the commode, I was six years old I would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold Never knew how she was sufferin' for my food and clothes  She asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread I said, He's missin' an arm, and he seem like a pee-pee head She said, don't cuss and my teeth to go brush And get ready for bed and the toilet to flush  With tears in my mama's eyes, I was her everything Before she went out on the stroll She'd tuck me into bed and sing You're just too beautiful for words You're just too beautiful for words You're just too beautiful for words You're just too beautiful for words [Verse 3] I see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies Reminds me of midnight in a dope fiend's eyes And my nine-year-old self as paramedics leave Left to bawl my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve  To give illustrations that are clear and clean I'll take you two hours back, before this scene Early in the morning when the sun starts to creep When the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep  Moms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink Wearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini and fake mink Even though she served for fifty dollars-a-pop Hardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped  That day the landlady got her rent before he got his knot Slammed mama's head against the front bolt lock Then the pimp with one arm done harm Reached back and plowed into her head like a farm  Never saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin' Heard the blap blap of twenty head crack percussion And body blows, her body froze from bolos to the spine I was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine  She didn't even have the strength to say, I love you, Boo But I said it to her and she knew that I knew She was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case But I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face  Stop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions Go to Frisco, I got very friendly vocal inflections Mob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night  [Hook] Oakland, do you wanna ride? I can't hear you, Oakland do you want to ride tonight? Oakland, do you wanna ride? I can't hear you, Oakland do you want to ride tonight?  [Verse 4] The rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world Or that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled My temperature gauge read, cold and blistery Spinnin' wheels made each piece of asphalt history  This was Jesus debut out the penitentiary Fifteen years, but it seem like a century See, he went in the pen for some other murder drama Twelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp, comma  You accidentally killed my moms, no player hatin' points You know how bitches act, shit, exclamation point First it was a set up move, then it was the truth His letters were the only friends that I had as a youth  But his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit So my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick 'Cause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus To me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers  And I don't think that it's gonna end till we make revolution But who gonna make the shit if we worship prostitution? Ain't no women finna die for the same old conclusion Put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em  Pulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery Pulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery Jesus said, Why the hell you pointin' a gat So I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat  I said, This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on This is for my mental and my mama that I cried on Microsoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones But since I'm Macintosh, I'mma double click your icon  He struggled for life, then gave up the fight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night  [Hook] Oakland, do you wanna ride? I can't hear you, Oakland do you want to ride tonight? Oakland, do you wanna ride? I can't hear you, Oakland do you want to ride tonight?  [Boots] And I still remember mama You're much too beautiful for words You're much too beautiful for words You're much too beautiful for words You're much too beautiful for words  [Hook] Oakland, do you wanna ride?

Cook some yayo Holla one-time when I say so Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hitting fences NARCs on a nigga's back, missing me by inches And they say: How do you survive weighing 165 In a city where the skinny niggas die? Tell Mama don't cry, 'cause even when they kill me They can never take the game from a young G I'm Str8 ballin'!

Drama is the nuclear threat that we live with One bomb and everybody's dead that's some sick shit Drama is HIV statistics The infected person that you might have sex with, life goes on But drama is living with the afterthought that maybe you could have prevented it Drama is imminent, it comes in other forms The sick pedophiles who support child porn Never mind the offenders Think about what the victims go through and what the fuck they gotta' live wit Drama is the prison population Some belong there but also some belong on probation Drama is not being able to change one thing Cause the system you live in says you ain't shit Drama is corporate scandal Drama is a handful of CEO's playin' you for a damn fool Drama is being a millionaire But gotta' recoup half the budget from your 10 percent share Drama is having one too many women Even though you always need a spare one to swim in Drama is dealing with your jealous impulses Learning how to hold it all in with no emotion Drama is blind devotion Drama is having your deepest secrets exposed in the open Drama is having your heart broken And the person who broke it doesn't even motherfucking notice Drama is trying to carry a burden all by yourself on your shoulders and it don't exist Drama is being falsely accused, Drama is the latest news Drama is what gives people clues Drama is a tool you can use to distract ya' enemy so they never improve Drama is the fear of devils and the fear of God Drama is a long and hard Tech support desk job Drama is the life of an up-and-coming actor or rapper Or athlete or building contractor Drama is a rookie cop calling for backup The 3 strike perpetrator that's getting tatted up Drama is the spin zone of a politician Drama is K-Solo when he said the rhyme did it Drama is the struggle of change Drama is inevitable there is no other way Drama is what drains life force out of you Drama is negative but drama can empower you Drama is love, Drama is pain Drama exists in everything everyday Drama is the Yin, Drama is the Yang Drama is the innate nature of man Drama contracts, Drama expands Drama is what I am [Interlude: Canibus] Drama! Drama!  [Verse 2: Luminati] Pull up a chair to the aristocracy of commonwealth prophecy The legacy of generation three isosceles Logical geometry, illogical melodies Integrated with memories that mix melodically Beyond the insight of what a modern-day monkey sees Get chopped in three for pathetic hypocrisy False bureaucracy breeds poetic monopolies Chateau de Trevano is my property An addict for drama and dramatic oddities Addicted to bottles of sticky green botany In a reflection of the split seas you see me in 3D Tripping off three hits of E Half-a-tablet for you 2-and-a-half for me A rappers speech is slurred for eternal depravity Naturally ignore gravity project astrally Ascend gradually till the stratosphere passes me Earth's actually esoterically absent to me Take a crack at me with blurred clarity - battle me Spiders crawl outta the skin the six headed beast Evil beings that wrestle with demons in the deep Useless to eat 200 pounds of rotten meat Shrink heads drink black milk collect black teeth Luminati tribal chief wear it as trophy piece My women are ornamented with a blood soaked wreath Like Christmas minus Christ plus the heat The Ascended Master, leader of all immortal freaks Voodoo curse on your last and future release Unleash the worst plague put the world under siege Till your name is unheard and your face is unseen Till your just a nightmare of an accursed dream Tell the supreme to curse your whole team and your unborn seed Poison your queen like the Furher's last week In the blood filled streets you're a leech Less than a man a poverty stricken thief with grief At night you speak to Satan before you go to sleep Worshiping the flesh like poor pagan priests Your future's oblique I command your heart to seize its beat Thou shall inherit disease and defeat!

Like the world's interrupting my song, with an interlude Can't y'all see I'm busy trying to balance out my chemical? Finishing up, what y'all ain't even begin to do When your back's against the ropes it's either him or you Y'all ain't so important that my words are meant for you When did ey'body become so sensual Caught up in the he-say, she-say, blog sites Him and her, broke up, WorldStar, Nahright Dumb fans, they believe, everything that y'all write Found out, friends fake, couldn't even facade right Pressures on, won't fail, nigga got too much to prove Would've been, lost it, but I got too much to lose Say what you want about Joe, but I stood my ground Bitch, I get it up myself, you just put it down They say, I put my whole life on display to my dismay Stop it, you're carrying on without logic Let me tell you this about Joe I only say what I want you to hear You'll only see what I want to show Crushing up the Percocet, chasing the high, Talli I couldn't make this shit up if I tried The forecast shows a downpour Y'all just made God cry, praying for my Downfall [Transition] This shit I'm talking 'bout right here Let me tell you niggas something You can be anything in this world that you want Except for my downfall  [Verse 2] I'm a victim of society, circumstance or just feelings Was a nigga victimized? Or just willing? No blinds, no bags, just dealing No foundation or floor plan, just building Check it, nights bright, but the days dark Covered in tattoos, but hate art These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp Staring at the finish line, looking for a way to start I've been called everything, an extremist Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is Anything a nigga do, a nigga mean it And I won't let a person, place or thing come between it An opportunist is how they paint me But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me? Still I feel like my problems are great Shit, if I don't never solve em' I'm straight On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate So he had to figure I wouldn't be bothered by the weight I'm trying to change the pattern but it's on loop Even an outcast in my own group What's it mean when ey'body standing next to you expects of you Everything that comes wit a spectacle? If everywhere I go, I just leave behind residue Tell me, trust me, I won't think nothing less of you [Hook] I'm sorry I ain't around more Come up with me, or stay on the ground floor I don't need shelter from the downpour Y'all can be whatever you want, just not my downfall They tryna make me slow, tryna take me, no! Can't be my downfall They tryna knock my grind, I won't stop, I'm fine Can't be my downfall  [Verse 3] No moment of clarity The next fight showing is a rarity Severity in me against my growin popularity Rappers won't rap, I'm forced to believe they scared of me But can no longer use the scape goat, 'They not aware of me' So y'all can go and throw your little pot shots Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot I'm getting my head right, recollecting Y'all looking for some website resurrection Being that I got too much to lose Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that I'm accused No longer amused, affected my loved ones Now they startin' to bruise And I don't want no parts of that abuse Wouldn't wish upon my worst foe, a day in my shoes That'll just eliminate any excuse And why entertain em'? Old me would'a lost my senses, y'all just helping the new me regain em' Been punched in the face It was either feed my family or hunt wit the .38 I ain't want brunch to wait I've out grown Hip-Hop, it turned into a Day-Care So next time some shit is on my mind, it'll stay there I'm staring at the man in the mirror But it ain't helping see the man any clearer So I get M.I.A from around y'all Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall [Hook]  [Verse 4] Tell me what am I to do If I ain't have a soul a nigga always had you, pardon due But I gotta speak candidly How the FUCK could you abandon me?!? Wit 5 years of blood, sweat and tears But it was obviously a disconnect We turned that into a disrespect Said she been holding it inside for years, she's unhappy So the girl I wan' marry was afraid to come and tap me So I went away on tour, and you went on one of your own But while you was on the horn all day wit ol' boy Did you ever think about what it would do to your home? What's his name? Where's he live? What is it he offers? What's he got to give? And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs I hit you like a man, you wore it in your ribs I was heated But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see what's underneath it Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated Mistreated, and kept it a big secret Or are you just loose? And I'm so naive I'm tryna give you an excuse Now that I refuse to believe, we life partners Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us Can't use anything I ever gave you to bury me You supposed to be the one to bury me You wan' leave? Then goodbye Think the grass look greener on the other side, but it's dye  [Hook]",

How's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan [Chorus: Dido] My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I Got out of bed at all The morning rain clouds up my window And I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray But your picture on my wall It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  [Verse 2: Eminem] Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old We waited in the blisterin' cold For you, for four hours, and you just said no That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on ‘Cause I don't really got shit else So that shit helps when I'm depressed I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me See, everything you say is real, and I respect you ‘cause you tell it My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7 But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S.

I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' 90 on the freeway Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive? You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin' Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it! You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you ‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!

Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was—it was you  [Outro] Damn…",

They're tryna tell me how to feel\n\nThis love is difficult but it's real\n\nDon't be afraid. We'll make it out of this mess\n\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh\n\n\n\nI got tired of waiting\n\nWondering if you were ever coming around\n\nMy faith in you was fading\n\nWhen I met you on the outskirts of town\n\nAnd I said\n\n\n\n\"Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone\n\nI keep waiting for you, but you never come\n\nIs this in my head? I don't know what to think.\"\n\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said\n\n\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone\n\nI love you, and that's all I really know\n\nI talked to your dad. Go pick out a white dress\n\nIt's a love story. Baby, just say 'Yes'.\"\n\n\n\nOh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\n\n\n\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you",
